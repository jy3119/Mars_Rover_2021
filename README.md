# Design-Project-2-2021-Summer

The command students will have different solutions that could be developed to communicate with the rover:
-A command-line interface that connects to a remote server over TCP to provide real-time logging and control of the system. This could be uploading commands to a database, that the rover then retrievesand executes.
-A purely local GUI using something like SDL or a static web page,that connects out over MQTT/HTTP/TCP toserver.
-A server side interface generated using HTML and something like react.
-A mobile app connecting back into a server with buttons for forward,back, rotate, etc.
-A web application using nodejs and mongodb as backend and reactjsas frontend.
